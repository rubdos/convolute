Convolution integral
====================

Written for the Vrije Universiteit Brussel for the course Complexe Analyse (Complex Analysis), this small C++ program calculates a convolution integral in a discrete way and plots it while calculation using gnuplot.
It is based on the slower matlab code used in the lessons.

Prerequisites
=============

You'll need a C++11 compiler, the boost libraries and gnuplot to complile the program.
On a Linux system with GCC > 4.8 and boost installed:
```shell
$ ./complile.sh
```

Special thanks to Gabriel Hollander and Philippe Cara for teaching us complex analysis.
